MS-paint like app that lets you draw on a canvas and view changes with a slider

### Running this program
Clone this repo and add it as an existing project in any Java IDE. Alternatively,
execute 'make run' in the root directory.

### Features
The interface of this application is very similar to that of MS Paint, however one
obvious addition of this application will be the interactive slider- To view previously
made changes to the canvas, simply move the slider back from the default (rightmost) 
position and the canvas will display its state before the most recently made strokes.
Simply move the slider back to the right to have it show everything that has been drawn.

To undo, move the slider back to any point and draw on the canvas again- this will delete
any visual changes that were hidden from moving the slider.
